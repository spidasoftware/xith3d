This package is intended to encapsulate information regarding various tiny changes we must accomodate
based on the executing environment.  In this way, we can keep track of all the little workarounds so
that they do not become completely scattered throughout the system.  This allows us to enforce
documentation through the use of the compiler and facilitates environment-specific testing. 
<p>
If you find yourself wanting to write something like the following:
<pre>
    foo();
    if ( "magic value".equals( System.getProperty( "blah" ) ) )
    {
        bar();
    }
</pre>
then you should place the metadata information here instead and rewrite your code to like this:
<pre>
    foo();
    if ( !EnvironmentCapabilities.getInstance().isVSyncSwitchingAllowed() )
    {
        bar();
    }
</pre>
</body>
